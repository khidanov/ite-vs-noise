## Robust Preparation of Ground State Phases Under Noisy Imaginary Time Evolution

Code for ["Robust Preparation of Ground State Phases Under Noisy Imaginary Time Evolution"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04285).

The DMRG code uses [ITensors.jl](https://itensor.github.io/ITensors.jl/dev/) package and can be utilized to compute ground states, Binder cumulants, energy gaps and state fidelities for the Ising spin ladder models with various inter-leg couplings.

The direct density matrix simulation uses [CuPy](https://cupy.dev) package for GPU-accelarated computing.
